# Cell Marker
This tool performs the following tasks:

1- Prompts the user to import:
  - one or more source Excel files
  - one target Excel file

2- Asks for the row number of the header and the name of the key column
(Some cells in the source files are marked with a character such as 'V' or 'X'.
This marker may appear in multiple columns of the same row.)

3- Prompts the user to specify the marker character.

4- A copy of the target file is created in the same path to which all changes are made.
The original target file remains untouched.

## Hints
- After installation, it may take a little while to start the software for the first time, but this should not be a problem.
- If the content of a single header cell consists of different colors, the process cannot recognize and transfer them accordingly.
Otherwise, the entire content of each header may have a different color than the others.
